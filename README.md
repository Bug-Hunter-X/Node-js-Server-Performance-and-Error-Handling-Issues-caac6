# Node.js Server Performance and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a Node.js server with performance and error-handling issues and shows how to improve it. 

The original `server.js` demonstrates a basic server that struggles under load and doesn't handle errors gracefully.

The improved `serverSolution.js` addresses these issues using techniques like connection pooling (if applicable to the context) and enhanced error handling.  The solution includes comprehensive logging to help debug and monitor the server.
